            <!-- Simple and easy to understand explanation of the operator -->
            <p>Subtraction is the <b> last or 6th operator</b> in the BODMAS rule.</p>
            <p>Any Subtractions are done last after any of the operators before it are completed.</p>
            <p>Subtraction has the mathematical operation of <b>'-'</b>.</p>
            <p>Remember the order in which you work through a calculation is according to <b>ORDER OF IMPORTANCE</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Below are some examples of BODMAS questions using subtraction to give you an idea:</b></p>
            <!-- Items are in an unordered list -->
            <ul>
                <li>42 - (11 - 5) = 42 - 6 = 36</li>
                <li>4 - 12 &divide; 4  = 4 - 3 = 1</li>
                <li>4<sup>2</sup> - 6 = 16 - 6 = 10</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below are some step by step examples of BODMAS questions using subtraction
               and where you might go wrong:
            </p>
            <!-- Items are in an ordered list -->
            <ol>
                <li> 8 - 24 &divide; 6</li>
                <p>Answer = 4</p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 8 - 24 as you may know to work from left to right
                   for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the order of importance, therefore you must do
                   calculate the division and finally subtract.</p>
                <p><b>Here is a further step by step breakdown for you to understand:</b></p>

                <li>17 - 2 x (3 + 2)</li>
                <p>Answer = 7 </p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 17 - 2 as you may know to work from left to right 
                   for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the order of importance, therefore you must 
                   calculate what is in the brackets, then multify and finally subtract.</p>

                <li>(19 + 8) - 4 x 2</li>
                <p>Answer = 19 </p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 27 - 4 after calculating (19 + 8) = 27, you may 
                   know to work from left to right for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the order of
