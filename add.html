            <!-- Simple and easy to understand explanation of the operator -->
            <p>Addition is the <b>5th operator</b> in the BODMAS rule.</p>
            <p>Any Additions are done after anything in brackets, orders, divisions and multiplications are done first.</p>
            <p>Addition has the mathematical operation of <b>'+'</b>.</p>
            <p>Remember the order in which you work through a calculation is according to <b>ORDER OF IMPORTANCE</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Below are some examples of BODMAS questions using addition to give you an idea:</b></p>
            <!-- Items are in an unordered list -->
            <ul>
                <li>6 + 4<sup>3</sup> = 6 + 64 = 70</li>
                <li>(9 + 35) &divide; 11 + 8 = 44 &divide; 11 + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12 </li>
                <li> 3 + 4 + 5 x (6 x 7) 1 = 3 + 4 + 5 x 42 = 3 + 4 + 210 = 7 + 120 = 217</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below are some step by step examples of BODMAS questions using addition
               and also included is where you might go wrong:
            </p>
            <!-- Items are in an ordered list -->
            <ol>
                <li>7 + 7 x 7 </li>
                <p>Answer = 56</p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 7 x 7 as you may know to work from left to right
                   for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the order of importance, therefore you must do
                   calculate the multiplication and finally add.</p>

                <li>12 + 15 &divide; 3</li>
                <p>Answer = 17 </p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 8 + 27 as you may know to work from left to right 
                   for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the order of importance, therefore you must 
                   calculate the order, then you divide and finally add.</p>

                <p>Answer = 9</p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 7 - 4 as you may know to work from left to right
                   for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the order of importance, therefore you must do
                   calculate the order, then you multify and finally add.</p>
