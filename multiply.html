            <p>Multiplication is the <b>4th operator</b> in the BODMAS rule</p>
            <p>Any multiplications are done after anything in brackets, orders and divisions are done first</p>
            <p>Multiplication has the mathematical operation of <b>'x'</b></p>
            <p>Remember the order in which you work through a calculation is according to <b>ORDER OF IMPORTANCE</b></p>
            <p><b>Below are some examples of BODMAS questions using division to give you an idea:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>8 &divide; 4 + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7</li>
                <li>(7x6) &divide; 2 = 42 &divide; 2 = 21</li>
                <li>1<sup>3</sup> &divide; 1 = 1 &divide; 1 = 1</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below are some step by step examples of BODMAS questions using multiplication
               and where you might go wrong:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>7 + 4 x 2<sup>2</sup></p></li>
                <p>Answer = 8</p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 7 - 4 as you may know to work from left to right
                   for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the order of importance, therefore you must do
                   calculate the order, then you multify and finally add.</p>
                <p><b>Here is a further step by step breakdown for you to understand:</b></p>
                <img scr = "example1.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
                <li>99 - 3<sup>3</sup> + 50 </p></li>
                <p>Answer = 22 </p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 99 - 27 after calculating 3<sup>3</sup> (= 27) 
                   as you may know to work from left to right for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the 
                   order of importance, therefore you must calculate the order, then you add and finally subtract.</p>
