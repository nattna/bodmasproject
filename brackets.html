            <!-- Simple and easy to understand explanation of the operator -->
            <p>Brackets (also known as parentheses) is the <b>1st operator</b> in the BODMAS rule.</p>
            <p>Anything you see in the brackets, you start with <b>first</b>.</p>
            <p>Remember the order in which you work through a calculation is according to <b>ORDER OF IMPORTANCE</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Below are some examples of BODMAS questions using order to give you an idea:</b></p>
            <!-- Items are in an unordered list -->
            <ul>
                <li>(3 x 5) - 14 = 15 - 14 = 1</li>
                <li>4 x (6 - 2)= 4 x 4 = 16</li>
                <li>77 - (3 x 4) + 5 = 77 - 12 + 5 = 65 + 5 = 70</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Below are some examples of BODMAS questions using brackets
                  and where you might go wrong:</b></p>
            <!-- Items are in an ordered list -->
            <ol>
                <li>20 - 2 x (3 + 3)</li>
                <p>Answer = 8</p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 20 - 2 as you may know to work from left to right
                   for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the order of importance. Therefore you must do
                   what is in the brackets first, then you multify and finally subtract.</p>

                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 40 - 7 after doing what is in the brackets
                   but, in BODMAS you work based on the order of importance, therefore you must do
                   what is in the brackets first, then you add and finally subtract.</p>
