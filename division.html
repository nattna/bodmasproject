            <h2 id="Divide">Division</h2>
            <p>Division is the <b>3rd operator</b> in the BODMAS rule</p>
            <p>Any divisions are done after anything in brackets or orders if there are any</p>
            <p>Division has the mathematical operation of <b>'&divide;'</b></p>
            <p>Remember the order in which you work through a calculation is according to <b>ORDER OF IMPORTANCE</b></p>
            <p><b>Below are some examples of BODMAS questions using division to give you an idea:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>8 &divide; 4 + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7</li>
                <li>(7x6) &divide; 2 = 42 &divide; 2 = 21</li>
                <li>1<sup>3</sup> &divide; 1 = 1 &divide; 1 = 1</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below are some step by step examples of BODMAS questions using division
               and where you might go wrong:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> 3 + 24 &divide; 6 
                </li>
                <p>Answer = 7</p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 3 + 24  as you may know to work from left to right
                   for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the order of importance, therefore you must do
                   calculate the division and then finally add.</p>
                <p><b>Here is a further step by step breakdown for you to understand:</b></p>
                <img src = "example7.png" style="width:600px;height:350px;">
                <li> 12 x (5<sup>2</sup>) &divide; 5</p></li>
                <p>Answer = 22 </p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 12 - 25 after calculating 5<sup>2</sup> (= -13) 
                   as you may know to work from left to right for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the 
                   order of importance, therefore you must calculate the order, then you divide and finally multify.</p>
                <p><b>Here is a further step by step breakdown for you to understand:</b></p>
                <img src = "example8.png" style="width:550px;height:350px;"></p>
                <li>7 x 54 &divide; 9 - 37</p></li>
                <p>Answer = 5</p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 7 x 54 as you may know to work from left to right
                   for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the order of importance, therefore you must do
                   calculate the division, then you multify and finally subtract.</p>
