            <!-- Simple and easy to understand explanation of the operator -->
            <p>Order is the <b>2nd operator</b> in the BODMAS rule.</p>
            <p>Any orders are done after anything in brackets if there are any.</p>
            <p>Orders can refer to either <b>powers, indicies, roots or exponents</b>
               (For example 2<sup>2</sup> = 4, 3<sup>3</sup> = 27).</p>
            <p>Remember the order in which you work through a calculation is according to <b>ORDER OF IMPORTANCE</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Below are some examples of BODMAS questions using order to give you an idea:</b></p>
            <!-- Items are in an unordered list -->
            <ul>
                <li>2<sup>2</sup> + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12</li>
                <li>3 x 5<sup>2</sup> = 3 x 25 = 75</li>
                <li>4<sup>3</sup> &divide; 4 = 64 &divide; 10 = 16</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Below are some examples of BODMAS questions using order
               and where you might go wrong:</b></p>
            <!-- Items are in an ordered list -->
            <ol>
                <li>7 + 4 x 2<sup>2</sup></li>
                <p>Answer = 23</p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 7 + 4 as you may know to work from left to right
                   for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the order of importance, therefore you must do
                   calculate the order, then you multify and finally add.</p>

                <p>Answer = 22 </p>
                <p>Potential mistake: You may end up calculating 99 - 27 after calculating 3<sup>3</sup> (= 27) 
                   as you may know to work from left to right for equations but, in BODMAS you work based on the 
                   order of importance, therefore you must calculate the order, then you add and finally subtract.</p>
